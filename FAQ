Since broadband internet is now pretty much essential for the vast majority of businesses, we include broadband and telecoms installations directly as part of the rental bill. These will all be pre-installed, so you can trust that when you see a studio to rent or office to let with BizSpace, you can get to work from the moment you arrive."
